Typescript Configuration
- Managing Projects with Typescript
- Configuring Type Checking & Compilation

41. Configure Typescript's behaviour - per project

    - create tsconfig.json file 
    (most of options doesn't matter)
        tsc --init


42. tsconfig options : Target & Libs

    < Language and Environment >
        
        "target": "es2016" 

            which verson of JS the Typescript code will be compiled 
        (e.x. when the project is web based, and needed to support old browsers too => es2016)

        "lib": ["DOM"]

            to include some standard libraries which Typescript is aware of
        (e.x. "DOM" library, which gives us all the HTML types, commented out : default)

        "jsx": "preserve"

            if we working on project that uses JSX, a React project, you can control how that JSX code should be treated when the Typescript code that contains JSX is compiled to JS code.
